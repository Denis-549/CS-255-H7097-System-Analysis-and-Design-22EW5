7-2 Portfolio Prep/Assignment for CS-255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? 
What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was called DriverPass. The owner was seeking to have an online driver training or Learning Management System called DriverPass. The system would be in the form of a website that will focus primarily on providing online driving courses, practice exams, as well as the ability to book on-the-road driving tests and/or training for (failing) drivers. The design of the system per the client would give users the ability to create their own accounts and select driving packages they want. The website would be cloud based; the owner will have full access to all the accounts in the system, while other users will have limited access, privileges and/or the ability to make changes on specific areas on the website. Key actors of the system include, existing student(s), instructor, guests, secretary, super admin, admin, payment system, and the DMV.  

What did you do particularly well?

I think creating the System design document and UML Diagrams were my most well thought out artifacts. Considering how critical both were in terms of describing the function(s), architecture, and design of software. I think being able to represent not only the software and its different functions from the user’s perspective but also having to ensure that the process of development (e.g. project plans, business cases, and risk assessments) itself is incorporated in key phases in the project.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

There seemed to have been more to the functional and non-functional requirements than I think I was able to capture in the project. Considering how critical requirements in terms of how it creating one uniform vision, and set of goals for both the internal teams as well as the client. The security and stability aspects within the nonfunctional requirements could be improved to include details covering the potential or flexibility of interfacing as well as integrating different platforms/versions like mobile, hearing impaired, or blind users. Requirements tend to change therefore being able to capture as much details especially during initiation meetings with the client will help mitigate some risks associated with frequent change requests etc. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

Understanding the user’s business objectives, potential value, future state description, scope of solution all from the perspective of an actor within the system or from the view point of an end-user helped me broke down the ask into two main (functional and nonfunctional) requirement categories. Breaking down requirements into topics (epics) then work items (user stories) with acceptance and validation criteria helped to clearly capture the user’s needs. 

The user’s needs help establish a guide, objective, and goal. Considering user’s, needs helps to eliminate ambiguity, poor decision making, decisions that could slow down development, disrupt deadlines, and result in additional development work. Without a user-defined parameters clearly laid out, it is impossible to understand or have a clear vision as to what constitutes a finished product or even a feature. Lack of user’s needs can lead to a lot of bugs, developers hardly being clear on the specifics of features. Even the client would hardly know what to expect by the end of development and what they are paying for. 


Kind regards,
